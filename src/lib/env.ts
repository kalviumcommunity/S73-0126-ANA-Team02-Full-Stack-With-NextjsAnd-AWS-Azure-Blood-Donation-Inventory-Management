/**
 * Environment access helpers.
 *
 * Security model:
 * - Public variables: prefixed with NEXT_PUBLIC_. These may be embedded in client bundles and
 *   are therefore considered non-secret. They can be read in both Server and Client Components.
 * - Private variables: NOT prefixed. These must ONLY be read on the server (e.g., API routes,
 *   server actions, database layers). Never import server-only functions into client components.
 *
 * Usage:
 * - Provide real values via runtime environment (.env files locally, GitHub Secrets in CI, Docker `-e`).
 * - Do not hardcode secrets in source control. Only `.env.example` is committed as a template.
